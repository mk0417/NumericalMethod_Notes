# Notes for Numerical Methods in Quantitative Macro
Slides prepared for teaching numerical methods in quantitative macroeconomics, especially for heterogeneous agent models in general equilibrium with aggregate shocks.
**WARNING: IN PROGRESS**

There seems to be an ongoing interest in this set of lecture notes, but please be aware that they are incomplete. I'll have them updated in a few months.
